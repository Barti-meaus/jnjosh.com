Hi, I’m Josh Johnson. I’m a software developer, wannabe designer, filmmaker, and podcaster living in Raleigh, NC with my wife, my two teenagers (!), a comfort retriever named Ruby, and two cats. I’ve been developing software since I was about 10 when my Dad gave me a Macintosh Plus with some form of BASIC. I still have that Macintosh to this day; and it works.

My passion is writing software for Mac and iOS. For years I wrote software for Windows and the Web, but when the iPhone was introduced in 2007 I dusted off my old 12” PowerBook and started learning Cocoa. This lead to my current position as the Director of Development with Two Toasters in Durham where I help create insanely great apps. I’m also organizer of Triangle CocoaHeads and NSCoder Nights and occasionally speak at conferences about Cocoa development.
