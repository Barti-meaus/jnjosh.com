# Numeralingual

Have you tried learning a new language? Do you spend time trying to decode numbers quickly? I had a thought that 
you could just have a game that forced you to quickly decode numbers. It's rough to start but it'll improve over 
timeâ€”before I release it to everyone

The game generates 4 random numbers, then the phone says one out loud in your target language. How many can you
guess right in 30 seconds?
