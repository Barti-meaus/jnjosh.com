We continued our weekend [One Charge Trips][1] this weekend and went to the [Hopscotch Festival][2] in Raleigh. The performances by Phantogram and Chvrches were great. We found some good seats without people in front of us or behind us, so we could sit or stand when we wanted. It also gave me the opportunity to be cooler than my daughter who just went to a Jonas Bros concert this week.
