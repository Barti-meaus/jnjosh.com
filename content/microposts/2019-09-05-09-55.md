Watching the US Open—and really all tennis—is fun but I can't get over the odd behaviors they direct the cameras to take. They'll have shots shaming fans who move during a point to ultra zooms into a player's arms or legs. I'm just imagining the director saying "now zoom into the clock and slowly rack focus".
