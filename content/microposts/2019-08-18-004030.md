I did some updates to my hugo theme, [“Internet Weblog”](https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog) to update support for newer version of Hugo. I realized I never gave it a meaningful version log so I hope I didn't break anything for anyone using it. If you use it and see problems please let me know!
