Soâ€¦ I've been thinking about replacing my 2015 MacBook Pro and Windows PC I built in 2016 with something new. I decided to pick up a new 13" M1 MacBook Pro. It's definitely much faster than my old Mac, but the battery life is unbelievable. I've been working on it all night since unboxing it. It started around 60% and 8 hours later I'm only down to 30%.
