# What I'm doing now

- Working at [Highrise](http://www.highrisegame.com) building out a social networking game. Getting to learn a lot about game engine development, C++, and more.

- Organizing [CocoaHeads](https://meetup.com/nscoderrtp). This year already has had some great talks and there is more to come.

- Getting back into gaming on the PC. I built a new desktop for this and playing things from Overwatch to Doom. 

- Learning to Draw! After years of not doing film-making, I've been diving into drawing so that I can tell visual stories in comic book form. I have an idea for a small comic strip to start and am working on building out how do to that.

- Learning German for both my love of the language and a potential future trip to Germany. I'm currently trying to do at least one lesson on [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com)
