# What I'm doing now

- Working at [Highrise](http://www.highrisegame.com) building out a social networking called [#me](https://hashtagme.app). We just launched out of Y Combinator last month (YC S18).

- Organizing [CocoaHeads](https://meetup.com/nscoderrtp). We are currently doing a bi-weekly meetup—A Swift Dinner—but I'm starting to think about restarting CocoaHeads.

- Learning to play the guitar… again. When I was a teenager my Dad bought me a cheap Squier Stratocaster. I learned the Nirvana nevermind tabs and some others, then let it go dormant. This time I'm trying to actually learn to play the instrument.

- Learning to Draw. This has taken a second seat to guitar, but I still try to draw at least once a day.

- Volunteering at [Code for Durham](http://codefordurham.com) to help build things to make lives better for people in Durham.

- I've switched from learning German to learning Spanish. I love languages and want to learn them all. I did Spanish in High School so I'm remembering a lot. I'm currently doing daily lessons on [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com)
