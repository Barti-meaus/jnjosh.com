# What I'm doing now

- Working at [Grubhub](https://www.grubhub.com) as a team lead on the Foundation team for the Diner facing iOS app.

- Organizing [Triangle CocoaHeads](https://www.meetup.com/trianglecocoa/). We are currently doing a bi-weekly meetupâ€”Swift Dinner.

- Getting back into filmmaking and working on a couple projects with my friend [Aravind](https://Aravind.media).

- Following the [Marie Kondo] method and tidying up our house. It's been life changing so far and we've made a small dent in all the stuff we own that doesn't bring us joy.
